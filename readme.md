Code challenge
=========

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to look at my solution.  

Version
--------------
Tested with ==> PHP 5.6.11

Installation
--------------
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BrendaManrique/cod-dictionaryUniques.git
```

Documentation
--------------
Documentation and project description can be found under the ./data directory. 

Input Files
--------------
1 input file is available.

words.txt (the input file provided with the requirements)

Run It...
--------------
2 output files

The information in the document was treated as lower case characters. The output of the solution: The document "uniques.txt" and "fullwords.txt" with every sequence of four letters that appears in exactly one word of the dictionary and it's corresponding word in the second file. I tried to go further and added an option to get all the words linked to every sequence of 4 characters. 


Thanks!
